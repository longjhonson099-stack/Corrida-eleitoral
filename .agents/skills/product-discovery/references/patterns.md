  #### **Name**
Opportunity Assessment
  #### **Description**
Evaluating what problems are worth solving
  #### **When To Use**
Deciding what to explore
  #### **Implementation**
    ## Opportunity Assessment Framework
    
    ### 1. Opportunity Solution Tree
    
    ```
    Desired Outcome (business goal)
    └── Opportunity 1 (customer problem)
        ├── Solution A
        ├── Solution B
        └── Solution C
    └── Opportunity 2
        └── ...
    └── Opportunity 3
        └── ...
    ```
    
    ### 2. Opportunity Evaluation Criteria
    
    | Criterion | Question | Score (1-5) |
    |-----------|----------|-------------|
    | Frequency | How often does problem occur? | |
    | Intensity | How painful is the problem? | |
    | Willingness | Would they pay/switch? | |
    | Reach | How many customers affected? | |
    | Alignment | Does it serve our strategy? | |
    
    ### 3. Opportunity Sizing
    
    ```
    Market Opportunity =
      (Customers affected) ×
      (Frequency of problem) ×
      (Willingness to pay/switch)
    ```
    
    **Quick Sizing**
    - How many customers have this problem?
    - How often do they encounter it?
    - What's their current workaround?
    - How much time/money do they lose?
    
    ### 4. ICE Scoring
    
    | Factor | Definition | Score |
    |--------|------------|-------|
    | Impact | If solved, how big is the impact? | 1-10 |
    | Confidence | How sure are we this is real? | 1-10 |
    | Ease | How easy to solve? | 1-10 |
    
    Score = (Impact × Confidence × Ease) / 10
    
    ### 5. Opportunity Prioritization Matrix
    
    ```
               High Impact
                   │
       ┌───────────┼───────────┐
       │ Quick wins│ Big bets  │
       │           │           │
     Low──────────────────────High Effort
       │ Maybe     │ Avoid     │
       │ later     │           │
       └───────────┼───────────┘
               Low Impact
    ```
