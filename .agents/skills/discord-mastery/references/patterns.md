    ### Channel Count Guidelines
    | Server Size | Max Channels | Categories |
    |-------------|--------------|------------|
    | < 500 | 10-15 | 3-4 |
    | 500-2K | 15-25 | 4-6 |
    | 2K-10K | 25-40 | 6-8 |
    | 10K+ | 40-60 | 8-12 |
    
    ### Common Mistakes
    - Too many channels (cognitive overload)
    - No clear purpose per channel

  #### **Description**
Permission-based role hierarchy
  #### **When To Use**

  #### **Implementation**
    ## Role Hierarchy
    
    ### Standard Roles (Top to Bottom)
    ```
    ADMIN (Full perms)
    ├── Lead Moderator
    ├── Senior Moderator
    ├── Moderator
    ├── Trial Moderator
    ├── VIP/OG
    ├── Active Member
    ├── Verified
    └── New Member
    ```
    
    ### Role Assignment
    | Role | How Earned | Perks |
    |------|------------|-------|
    | Verified | Complete onboarding | Basic access |
    | Active | Time + activity | More channels |
    | VIP | Contribution | Special access |
    | Mod | Application/invite | Mod tools |
    
    ### Permission Best Practices
    - Start restrictive, grant permissions up
    - Use role hierarchy properly
    - Avoid @everyone permissions
    - Regular permission audits

    ## Bot Strategy
    
    ### Essential Bots

    | Leveling | MEE6, Tatsu, Arcane | Optional |
    | Tickets | Ticket Tool, Carl-bot | For support |

    - Test before deploying
    - Document all bot settings
    - Regular bot audits
    
    ### Automod Setup
    | Rule | Action | Notes |
    |------|--------|-------|
    | Spam | Delete + warn | Link cooldown |
    | Slurs | Delete + timeout | Use blocklist |
    | Raids | Lockdown | Mention spam |
    | Scams | Delete + ban | Crypto scams |
