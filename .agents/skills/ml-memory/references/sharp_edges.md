# Ml Memory - Sharp Edges

## Entity Duplication Explosion

### **Id**
entity-duplication-explosion
### **Summary**
Same entity appears hundreds of times with different names
### **Severity**
critical
### **Situation**
  You ingest user conversations without entity resolution. Months later,
  you realize "John", "John Smith", "my husband", "him", and "Dr. Smith"
  are all the same person with 5 different memory graphs.
  
### **Why**
  Users refer to entities in many ways. Without resolution, each variant
  creates new nodes. Queries return fragmented results. Memory is split
  across entities that should be unified.
  
### **Solution**
  # Implement entity resolution pipeline
  class EntityResolver:
      CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7
  
      async def resolve_or_create(
          self,
          mention: str,
          context: str,
          user_id: UUID,
      ) -> Entity:
          # 1. Exact match first
          exact = await self.db.find_entity_exact(mention, user_id)
          if exact:
              return exact
  
          # 2. Semantic similarity search
          candidates = await self.find_similar_entities(
              mention, context, user_id
          )
  
          for candidate in candidates:
              # 3. LLM-based coreference resolution
              is_same, confidence = await self.llm_coreference_check(
                  mention, context, candidate
              )
  
              if is_same and confidence > self.CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
                  # 4. Add alias to existing entity
                  await self.add_alias(candidate, mention)
                  return candidate
  
          # 5. Create new entity only if no match
          return await self.create_entity(mention, user_id)
  
  # Run periodic entity merge jobs to fix historical issues
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Memory graph has duplicate nodes for same person
  - Queries miss relevant memories because entity name differs
  - Entity count growing linearly with conversation length
  - User says 'I already told you about John' but system doesn't find it

## Zep Graphiti Llm Costs

### **Id**
zep-graphiti-llm-costs
### **Summary**
LLM calls during every ingestion creates massive API bills
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
  You use Graphiti/Zep's entity extraction which calls LLM for every
  ingested message. At scale, you're making 100K+ LLM calls per day
  just for entity extraction.
  
### **Why**
  Graphiti uses LLMs for entity extraction, relationship detection, and
  summarization. Each ingested message can trigger 2-5 LLM calls.
  At conversation scale, this becomes prohibitively expensive.
  
### **Solution**
  # Batch extraction to reduce LLM calls
  class BatchEntityExtractor:
      BATCH_SIZE = 10
      MAX_BATCH_DELAY = timedelta(seconds=30)
  
      def __init__(self):
          self.pending_messages = []
          self.last_flush = datetime.utcnow()
  
      async def queue_for_extraction(self, message: Message) -> None:
          self.pending_messages.append(message)
  
          if (
              len(self.pending_messages) >= self.BATCH_SIZE or
              datetime.utcnow() - self.last_flush > self.MAX_BATCH_DELAY
          ):
              await self.flush()
  
      async def flush(self) -> List[Entity]:
          if not self.pending_messages:
              return []
  
          # Single LLM call for entire batch
          combined_text = "\n---\n".join(
              m.content for m in self.pending_messages
          )
  
          entities = await self.llm.extract_entities(combined_text)
  
          # Clear batch
          self.pending_messages = []
          self.last_flush = datetime.utcnow()
  
          return entities
  
  # Also consider: local NER models for first pass
  # spacy, GLiNER, or fine-tuned BERT for entity extraction
  # Only use LLM for relationship inference
  
### **Symptoms**
  - API costs growing linearly with message volume
  - Ingestion latency high due to LLM calls
  - Rate limit errors from embedding/LLM provider
  - Entity extraction is slowest part of pipeline

## Temporal Staleness Current

### **Id**
temporal-staleness-current
### **Summary**
"Current" facts become stale without temporal validity
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
  You store "user works at Google" as a fact. Six months later,
  user mentions new job. System still retrieves old job as current
  because it has higher salience.
  
### **Why**
  Facts have temporal validity. "Current job" changes. "Lives in"
  changes. Without valid_until handling, stale facts accumulate
  and pollute retrieval.
  
### **Solution**
  # Always store temporal validity for mutable facts
  @dataclass
  class MemoryFact:
      entity_id: UUID
      predicate: str  # "works_at", "lives_in"
      value: str

      # Mutable predicates that need temporal handling
      MUTABLE_PREDICATES = {
          "works_at", "lives_in", "married_to", "age",
          "role", "company", "location", "status",

          )

## Consolidation Conflicts

### **Id**
consolidation-conflicts
### **Summary**
Concurrent consolidation corrupts memory state
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
  You run consolidation jobs on a schedule. Two jobs overlap because
  the first one took longer than expected. Memories get promoted twice
  or corrupted.
  
### **Why**
  Consolidation reads, processes, and writes memory state. Without
  locking, concurrent jobs read same state, make conflicting decisions,
  and corrupt data.
  
### **Solution**
  # Use distributed locking for consolidation
  from redis.lock import Lock

## Salience Never Decreases

### **Id**
salience-never-decreases
### **Summary**
Salience only increases, noise accumulates
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
  You implement salience boosting when memories are accessed. Over time,
  all frequently accessed memories have max salience. The ranking becomes
  meaningless.
  
### **Why**
  Without decrease mechanism, salience saturates. Old but once-useful
  memories stay at top. New important memories can't compete. The
  system becomes increasingly noisy.

## Forgetting Breaks References

### **Severity**

### **Situation**
  You implement memory forgetting to manage storage. A memory is forgotten,

## Embedding Model Mismatch

Query embeddings from different model than stored embeddings

  You upgrade your embedding model. New queries use the new model,

## Memory Attribution Missing

  You want to implement outcome-based learning but realize you never

  you can't close the learning loop.

### **Symptoms**
  - Can't implement outcome-based learning
  - No data on which memories were useful
  - Salience remains static
  - Can't debug why bad memories were retrieved
### **Detection Pattern**
retrieve.*memor|search.*memor(?!.*trace|.*log)
### **Version Range**
>=1.0.0
