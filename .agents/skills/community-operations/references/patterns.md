## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Mod Burnout Factory
  #### **Description**
Overworking volunteer moderators
  #### **Why Bad**
    Volunteers have limits. Burned out mods quit or become toxic.
    No recognition leads to resentment. Inconsistent coverage hurts community.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Set clear shift expectations. Rotate responsibilities.
    Recognize contributions publicly. Check in on mental health.
    Build mod team, not mod heroes.
    

---
  #### **Name**
Rule Lawyer Moderation
  #### **Description**
Applying rules without context or empathy
  #### **Why Bad**
    Communities are human, not courtrooms.
    Technically correct but emotionally wrong damages trust.
    Members feel policed, not supported.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Train mods on intent behind rules. Empower judgment calls.
    Default to empathy, escalate edge cases.
    Focus on outcomes, not just rules.
    

---
  #### **Name**
Invisible Until Crisis
  #### **Description**
Mods only visible when enforcing rules
  #### **Why Bad**
    Members see mods as police, not community members.
    No relationship built before conflict.
    Enforcement feels punitive, not protective.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Mods participate as regular members too.
    Positive interactions outnumber enforcement.
    Build relationships before needing to moderate.
