    - [ ] 3mm bleed on all edges (0.125" for US manufacturers)
    - [ ] Safe zone: 4-5mm from cut line for critical elements
    - [ ] Game boards: 10mm bleed for fold-over edges
    
    ### Typography
    - [ ] All fonts converted to outlines/paths
    - [ ] Minimum 8pt for body text
    - [ ] Minimum 6pt for footnotes/fine print
    - [ ] 7pt+ for reversed text (light on dark)
    - [ ] Sans-serif fonts preferred at small sizes
    
    ### Images
    - [ ] Resolution: 300 DPI minimum at final print size
    - [ ] All images embedded (not linked)
    - [ ] No upscaling of low-res images
    
    ### File Format
    - [ ] PDF/X-4 or PDF/X-1a

Unboxing Experience Design
  #### **Description**
Creating memorable first impressions through packaging
  #### **When**
Designing premium packaging or improving user experience
  #### **How**
    ## The Science of Unboxing
    
    Unboxing triggers dopamine release through anticipation. Design your packaging
    to maximize this effect through deliberate reveal sequences.
    
    ## Reveal Sequence Framework
    
    ### Layer 1: External (Anticipation)
    - First visual impression
    - Shrink wrap or belly band removal
    - Box texture and weight
    - **Goal:** Build anticipation
    
    ### Layer 2: Lid Opening (Reveal)
    - Lid resistance (slow, satisfying lift)
    - First glimpse of contents
    - Hidden message under lid (optional)
    - **Goal:** Dopamine spike
    
    ### Layer 3: Component Discovery (Satisfaction)
    - Organized, inviting layout
    - Each component in its place
    - Progressive revelation of depth
    - **Goal:** Perceived value
    
    ### Layer 4: Hidden Delights (Surprise)
    - Secret compartments
    - Messages under insert
    - Thank you card or bonus content
    - **Goal:** Emotional connection
    
    ## Practical Techniques
    
    **Vacuum Effect (Apple-style)**
    - Precise lid fit creates air resistance
    - Lid lifts slowly, dramatically
    - Requires tight tolerances (±0.5mm)
    
    **Tissue Paper Wrap**
    - Adds tactile layer
    - Covers components on first open
    - Creates unwrapping moment
    
    **Ribbon Pulls**
    - For heavy or snug inserts
    - Adds color accent
    - Premium feel at low cost
    
    **Printed Insert Underside**
    - Hidden art or message
    - Revealed when components removed
    - Easter egg for engaged customers
    
    ## Multi-Sensory Design
    
    | Sense | Element | Example |
    |-------|---------|---------|
    | Sight | Color, composition | Premium matte black with gold foil |
    | Touch | Texture, weight | Soft-touch coating, substantial box |
    | Sound | Opening sounds | Magnetic click, paper rustle |
    | Smell | Material scent | Fresh cardboard, wood components |

      → Consider: urgency, component complexity
    
    IF quantity 1000-3000:
      → China likely most cost-effective
      → Get quotes from 2-3 manufacturers
    
    IF quantity 3000+:
      → Definitely China
      → Negotiate pricing, consider multiple vendors
    ```
    
    ## Shipping Cost Reality
    
    From China to USA:
    - 1 pallet (500 units): ~$1,500-2,000 ($3-4/unit)
    - 5 pallets (2,500 units): ~$2,500-3,000 ($1/unit)
    - Full container (5,000+ units): ~$3,000-4,500 ($0.60-0.90/unit)
    
    **Key insight:** Shipping cost per unit drops dramatically with volume.

  #### **Name**
Cost Optimization Strategies
  #### **Description**
Reducing manufacturing costs without sacrificing quality
  #### **When**
Trying to hit a target price point or improve margins
  #### **How**
    ## Component Nesting Optimization
    
    The single biggest cost saver most designers miss.
    
    ### Card Nesting
    - Standard press sheet: Fits 54-64 poker cards
    - Optimal deck sizes: 54, 108, 162 (multiples of sheet)
    - 55 cards = same cost as 54 (one sheet)
    - 70 cards = same cost as 108 (two sheets)
    
    ### Punchboard Nesting
    - Design tokens to share die-cut patterns
    - Rectangular tokens much cheaper than custom shapes
    - Example: Two 4"x5.5" sheets cheaper than one 8"x11"
      (Same paper, but simpler die)
    
    ### Box Sizing
    - Standard sizes have existing dies
    - Custom sizes = new die ($200-500)
    - Match box to existing manufacturer templates when possible
    
    ## Material Substitutions
    
    | Premium | Budget Alternative | Savings |
    |---------|-------------------|---------|
    | Black core cards | Blue core | 15-20% |
    | Thermoform insert | Cardboard insert | 50-70% |
    | Foil stamping | Spot UV | 40-50% |
    | Linen finish | Standard coating | 5-10% |
    | Custom dice | Standard dice + stickers | 60-80% |
    | Custom meeples | Cubes/standard shapes | 70-90% |
    
    ## Print Run Economics
    
    ```
    Per-unit cost breakdown (typical game):
    
    500 units:  $12-15/unit
    1000 units: $8-10/unit
    2000 units: $6-8/unit
    5000 units: $4-6/unit
    10000 units: $3-5/unit
    
    The jump from 500→1000 often gives 25-35% savings
    ```
    
    ## Hidden Costs to Account For
    
    1. **Freight forwarding:** $0.50-2/unit depending on volume
    2. **Import duties:** 0-25% depending on country
    3. **Warehousing:** $0.50-2/unit/month
    4. **Fulfillment:** $2-5/unit
    5. **Damaged/defect allowance:** 2-5% of units
    
    ## Negotiation Levers
    
    - **Payment terms:** 30% deposit / 70% before shipping (standard)
    - **Repeat orders:** 5-15% discount on reorders
    - **Combined shipping:** Share container with other publishers
    - **Off-peak timing:** Better rates during slow seasons (Jan-Feb)

  #### **Name**
RGB Design Workflow
  #### **Description**
Designing in RGB and converting to CMYK at the end
  #### **Why Bad**
    RGB has a much larger color gamut than CMYK. Neon greens, electric blues, and
    saturated oranges that look vibrant on screen become muddy when converted.
    You won't know how your colors actually look until it's too late.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Start every project in CMYK. Set your color mode before creating the first shape.
    If you must use RGB assets, convert early and adjust colors while you still
    have time to iterate.
    
  #### **Severity**
critical

  #### **Name**
Ignoring Bleed
  #### **Description**
Artwork that stops exactly at the trim line
  #### **Why Bad**
    Die-cutting has ±1mm tolerance. Without bleed, you'll get random white edges
    on finished products. This screams "amateur" and cannot be fixed post-production.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Extend all edge-touching artwork 3mm beyond the trim line. Verify bleed on every
    file before submission. Use manufacturer templates that include bleed guides.
    
  #### **Severity**
critical

  #### **Name**
Pure Black (K100) for Large Areas
  #### **Description**
Using 100% black (K only) for backgrounds or large solid areas
  #### **Why Bad**
    K100 appears dark gray in print, not black. The single-ink coverage is insufficient
    for rich, deep blacks. Your "black" box will look washed out next to competitors.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Use rich black: C60-M40-Y40-K100 for large areas. Keep pure K100 only for small
    text where registration matters. Some prefer C50-M50-Y50-K100 for warmer black.
    
  #### **Severity**
high

---
  #### **Name**
Tiny Fonts for Game Text
  #### **Description**
Using 5pt or smaller fonts for text players need to read
  #### **Why Bad**
    Below 6pt, most fonts become illegible blobs. Players shouldn't need magnifying
    glasses. Accessibility matters - not everyone has perfect vision.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Minimum 8pt for body text, 6pt absolute minimum for legal text/footnotes.
    Use 7pt+ for reversed text (light on dark). Test print at actual size before
    finalizing. Sans-serif fonts maintain legibility better at small sizes.

Screen-Based Color Proofing
  #### **Description**
Approving colors based only on monitor display
  #### **Why Bad**
    Monitors vary wildly in color accuracy. Even calibrated screens don't perfectly
    represent CMYK output. What looks perfect on screen may disappoint in print.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Always request physical proofs from manufacturer. Use calibrated monitors as
    approximation only. For critical brand colors, specify Pantone spot colors.
    Build proof costs into project budget.

Unoptimized Component Nesting
  #### **Description**
Designing tokens and cards without considering print sheet layout
  #### **Why Bad**
    A deck of 70 cards costs the same as 108 cards (both require 2 sheets).
    Random token shapes waste expensive punchboard material. You're literally
    throwing money away with inefficient designs.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Design to sheet multiples: 54, 108, 162 cards. Keep tokens rectangular when
    possible. Group similar components on shared sheets. Ask manufacturer for
    sheet sizes early in design process.

Ignoring Component Tolerances
  #### **Description**
Designing insert compartments exactly to component dimensions
  #### **Why Bad**
    Components vary ±1mm. Cards expand when sleeved (+5mm). Tight compartments
    make setup frustrating and cause component damage. Nobody enjoys prying cards
    from too-tight slots.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Add clearance: +2mm for unsleeved cards, +5mm for sleeved. +3mm for tokens.
    Design for easy retrieval with finger cutouts. Test with actual components
    plus sleeves during prototyping.

Last-Minute Manufacturer Selection
  #### **Description**
Choosing manufacturer after design is complete
  #### **Why Bad**
    Each manufacturer has different templates, capabilities, and constraints.
    A design optimized for Panda GM may not work at Game Crafter. You may need
    to redo significant work or accept compromises.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Select manufacturer early. Get their templates and design guidelines before
    starting. Verify component availability. Build relationship through quote
    process before committing to design direction.

Single Proof Review
  #### **Description**
Approving production after seeing only one proof
  #### **Why Bad**
    First proofs often have issues. Color may need adjustment. Text errors hide.
    Structural problems only appear when physically assembled. One round of proofs
    catches maybe 70% of issues.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Budget for 2-3 proof rounds. Have multiple people review. Test-assemble
    physical proofs. Check colors in different lighting. Verify text with fresh
    eyes. Review takes time - build it into timeline.
