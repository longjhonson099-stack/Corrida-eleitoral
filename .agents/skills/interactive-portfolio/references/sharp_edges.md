# Interactive Portfolio - Sharp Edges

## Over Engineered Portfolio

### **Id**
over-engineered-portfolio
### **Summary**
Portfolio more complex than your actual work
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Spent 6 months on portfolio, have 2 projects to show
### **Why**
  Procrastination disguised as work.
  Portfolio IS a project, but not THE project.
  Diminishing returns on polish.
  Ship it and iterate.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Right-Sizing Your Portfolio
  
  ### The MVP Portfolio
  | Element | MVP Version |
  |---------|-------------|
  | Hero | Name + title + one line |
  | Projects | 3-4 best pieces |
  | About | 2-3 paragraphs |
  | Contact | Email + LinkedIn |
  
  ### Time Budget
  ```
  Week 1: Design and structure
  Week 2: Build core pages
  Week 3: Add 3-4 projects
  Week 4: Polish and launch
  ```
  
  ### The Truth
  - Your portfolio is not your best project
  - Shipping beats perfecting
  - You can always iterate
  - Better projects > better portfolio
  
  ### When to Stop
  - Core pages work on mobile
  - 3-4 solid projects showcased
  - Contact form works
  - Loads in < 3 seconds
  - Ship it.
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Been "working on portfolio" for months
  - More excited about portfolio than projects
  - Portfolio tech more impressive than work
  - Afraid to launch
### **Detection Pattern**
not ready|still working|almost done|perfecting

## Mobile Broken

### **Id**
mobile-broken
### **Summary**
Portfolio looks great on desktop, broken on mobile
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
Recruiters check on phone, everything breaks
### **Why**
  Built desktop-first.
  Didn't test on real devices.
  Complex interactions don't translate.
  Forgot about thumb zones.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Mobile-First Portfolio
  
  ### Mobile Reality
  - 60%+ traffic is mobile
  - Recruiters browse on phones
  - First impression = mobile impression
  
  ### Mobile Must-Haves
  - Readable without zooming
  - Tappable links (min 44px)
  - Navigation works
  - Projects load fast
  - Contact easy to find
  
  ### Testing Checklist
  ```
  [ ] iPhone Safari
  [ ] Android Chrome
  [ ] Tablet sizes
  [ ] Slow 3G simulation
  [ ] Real device (not just DevTools)
  ```
  
  ### Graceful Degradation
  ```css
  /* Complex hover → simple tap */
  @media (hover: none) {
    .hover-effect {
      /* Show content directly */
    }
  }
  ```
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Looks great in browser DevTools
  - Broken on actual phone
  - Text too small
  - Buttons hard to tap
  - Navigation hidden
### **Detection Pattern**
mobile|phone|responsive|small screen

## No Call To Action

### **Id**
no-call-to-action
### **Summary**
Visitors don't know what to do next
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Great portfolio, zero contacts
### **Why**
  No clear CTA.
  Contact buried at bottom.
  Multiple competing actions.
  Assuming visitors will figure it out.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Portfolio CTAs
  
  ### Primary CTAs
  | Goal | CTA |
  |------|-----|
  | Get hired | "Let's work together" |
  | Freelance | "Start a project" |
  | Network | "Say hello" |
  | Specific role | "Hire me for [X]" |
  
  ### CTA Placement
  ```
  Hero section: Main CTA
  After projects: Secondary CTA
  Footer: Final CTA
  Floating: Optional persistent CTA
  ```
  
  ### Making Contact Easy
  - Email link (mailto:)
  - LinkedIn (opens new tab)
  - Calendar link (Calendly)
  - Simple contact form
  - Copy email button
  
  ### What to Avoid
  - Contact form only (people hate forms)
  - Hidden contact info
  - Too many options
  - Vague CTAs ("Learn more")
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Lots of views, no contacts
  - People don't know you're available
  - Contact page is afterthought
  - No clear ask
### **Detection Pattern**
no contacts|not hiring|how to reach|where.*email

## Outdated Projects

### **Id**
outdated-projects
### **Summary**
Portfolio shows old or irrelevant work
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Best work is 3 years old, newer work not shown
### **Why**
  Haven't updated in years.
  Newer work is "not ready."
  Scared to remove old favorites.
  Portfolio drift.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Portfolio Freshness
  
  ### Update Cadence
  | Action | Frequency |
  |--------|-----------|
  | Add new project | When completed |
  | Remove old project | Yearly review |
  | Update copy | Every 6 months |
  | Tech refresh | Every 1-2 years |
  
  ### Project Pruning
  Keep if:
  - Still proud of it
  - Relevant to target jobs
  - Shows important skills
  - Has good results/story
  
  Remove if:
  - Embarrassed by code/design
  - Tech is obsolete
  - Not relevant to goals
  - Better work exists
  
  ### Showing Growth
  - Latest work first
  - Date projects (or don't)
  - Show evolution if relevant
  - Archive instead of delete
  
### **Symptoms**
  - jQuery projects in 2024
  - I did this in college
  - Tech stack doesn't match target jobs
  - Haven't touched portfolio in 2+ years
