# Team Communications - Sharp Edges

## Slack Black Hole - Information Lost In Scroll

### **Id**
slack-black-hole
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
  Decision made in Slack thread after long discussion. Everyone agrees.
  Three weeks later: "Wait, what did we decide?" Search turns up nothing
  useful. Different people remember different conclusions. The decision
  has to be remade. This happens every month.
  
### **Why**
  Slack is designed for conversation, not storage. Important decisions
  buried in threads become unfindable. Slack search is weak for context.
  When information lives only in chat, it effectively doesn't exist
  for anyone who wasn't there at the moment.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Decision capture ritual:
     """
     AFTER ANY SLACK DECISION:
  
     In thread, post:
     "📝 Decision captured: [Link to doc/wiki]"
  
     The doc contains:
     - What was decided
     - Why (key points from discussion)
     - Who was involved
     - Date
     - Any open items
     """
  
  2. Create decision log:
     """

     | 3/12 | Rebrand Q2 | Market positioning | @ceo @marketing |
  
     One place to check: "Have we decided this before?"
     """
  
  3. Slack-to-doc automation:
     """
     Use /capture or Zapier:
     - Bookmark important threads
     - Auto-export to Notion
     - Weekly review of bookmarks
  
     "If it matters, it leaves Slack."
     """
  
  4. Culture of documentation:
     """
     NORM:
     "Slack is for discussion. Wiki is for decisions."
  
     When someone says "we decided X" without link:
     "Can you link the doc where that's captured?"
     """
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Didn't we already decide this?
  - Important decisions only in Slack
  - New hires can't find context
  - Repeated discussions

## Meeting Creep - Calendar Colonization

### **Id**
meeting-creep
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
  Company starts with few meetings. "Let's sync weekly." Turns into
  daily standups. Then sprint planning. Then retros. Then 1:1s. Then
  cross-team syncs. Engineer looks at calendar: 20 hours of meetings
  per week. Actual work happens at night. Burnout follows.
  
### **Why**
  Meetings are easy to add, hard to remove. Each one feels necessary
  when added. Cumulative effect isn't felt until calendar is full.
  "This meeting is important" is always true in isolation. The problem
  is aggregate: a culture that defaults to sync.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Meeting audit:
     """
     QUARTERLY MEETING AUDIT:
  
     For every recurring meeting, answer:
     1. What decision does this enable?
     2. Could this be async?
     3. Who really needs to be here?
     4. What's the cost (hours × people × weeks)?
  
     If can't answer #1, cancel it.

## Transparency Theater - Open But Not Honest

### **Id**
transparency-theater
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
  Company announces: "We're transparent! Everything is open!" All-hands
  meetings happen. Metrics dashboards shared. But: real problems are
  never discussed. Layoffs announced suddenly. Revenue issues hidden
  until crisis. People feel gaslit - "But I thought we were transparent?"
  
### **Why**
  There's a difference between data transparency and truth transparency.
  Sharing metrics isn't the same as sharing reality. When companies
  perform transparency without practicing it, trust erodes faster than
  if they'd never claimed transparency at all.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Transparency audit:
     """
     WHAT SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT:
  
     ALWAYS SHARE:
     - Company metrics (revenue, burn, runway)
     - Strategic challenges and concerns
     - Major decisions and reasoning
     - What leadership is worried about
  
     OKAY TO HOLD TEMPORARILY:
     - Personnel issues (privacy)
     - Active negotiations (timing)
     - Unconfirmed rumors (accuracy)
  
     NEVER HIDE:
     - Financial distress
     - Existential risks
     - Coming layoffs (give max notice)
     """
  
  2. Lowlights ritual:
     """

     "Here's what's keeping me up at night..."

     The things that aren't working. Employees know
     when things are hard - not sharing insults them.

  3. Premortem practice:
     """
     SHARE THE RISKS:
  
     "If we fail this quarter, it'll be because of:
     1. [Risk 1]
     2. [Risk 2]
     3. [Risk 3]
  
     Here's what we're doing about each."
  
     This is real transparency.

  4. Anonymous feedback channels:
     """
     CREATE SAFE CHANNELS:
     - Anonymous form for concerns
     - Regular review of submissions
     - Response in all-hands

     Here's the honest answer..."

## Async Anxiety - Fear of Missing Out on Slack

### **Id**
async-anxiety
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
  Team adopts async communication. But people are still on Slack all
  day. Anxious about missing something. Responding to messages immediately.
  Notifications never off. The async tools exist, but the sync behavior
  persists. No one gets deep work done.
  
### **Why**
  Async tools don't create async culture. Without explicit norms about
  response times and expectations, people assume they need to be always
  available. Fear of being seen as unresponsive keeps everyone tethered.
  The tool is async but the culture is still sync.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Explicit response time norms:
     """
     RESPONSE TIME EXPECTATIONS:
  
     Slack DM: Within 4 hours during work hours
     Slack Channel: Within 24 hours
     Email: Within 24-48 hours
     [URGENT] tag: Within 2 hours
  
     OUTSIDE WORK HOURS: No expectation
  
     "Not responding immediately is not only okay,
     it's expected."
     """
  
  2. Status discipline:
     """
     USE STATUS INDICATORS:
  
     🔴 Focus time - no interruptions
     🟡 Available but async preferred

     ⚫ Offline - not working
  
     Respect others' status. Model it yourself.

  3. Batch communication:
     """
     RECOMMENDED PATTERNS:
  
     Check Slack: 2-3 times per day
     Not: Always open in background
  
     Respond: In batches, not immediately
     Not: One-by-one as they arrive
  
     Deep work: Notifications off, status set
     Not: Half-attention always available
     """
  
  4. Leader modeling:
     """
     LEADERS MUST MODEL:
     - Delayed responses (not instant)
     - Offline weekends
     - Focus time visible on calendar
     - Not Slacking at 11pm
  
     "The CEO responds in 4 hours, not 4 minutes.
     You can too."

### **Symptoms**
  - Slack always open
  - Immediate responses expected
  - People working all hours
  - Guilt about not responding fast enough

## Announcement Fatigue - When Everything Is News

### **Id**
announcement-fatigue
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
  Marketing hired someone - announcement. New Slack emoji - announcement.
  Coffee machine fixed - announcement. Every week, multiple #general posts.
  People stop reading. Then: real news (fundraising, major change) gets
  lost in the noise. "I didn't see that" becomes common.
  
### **Why**
  Attention is finite. When routine events are announced with the same
  fanfare as significant news, people can't distinguish importance.
  The announcement channel becomes noise. Real signals get buried.
  The company loses its broadcast channel.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Announcement tiers:

     - New hires (leadership level)

## Knowledge Graveyard - Docs That Nobody Reads

### **Id**
knowledge-graveyard
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
  Company invests in Notion/Confluence. Beautiful structure created.
  Policies documented. Processes written. Six months later: outdated,
  unused, unsearchable. New hires still ask questions that should be
  answered in docs. The wiki becomes a graveyard of good intentions.
  
### **Why**
  Documentation is easy to create, hard to maintain. Without ownership,
  docs decay. Without discoverability, they're never found. Without
  integration into workflow, they're forgotten. The effort of creating
  isn't matched by effort to maintain and use.
  
### **Solution**

## Remote Second-Class - Hybrid Inequity

### **Id**
remote-second-class
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
  Company is "hybrid." Office people have hallway conversations, whiteboard
  sessions, lunch decisions. Remote folks join meetings via laptop propped
  on table, can't see the whiteboard, miss the pre-meeting chat. Decisions
  get made in office without remote input. Remote people feel left out.
  
### **Why**
  Hybrid is hard because proximity creates advantage. It's natural to
  include the person next to you and forget the person on screen.
  Without deliberate systems, hybrid devolves into office-first with
  remote as afterthought. Remote workers disengage and leave.

## Onboarding Info-Dump - Drinking From The Firehose

  New hire starts. Day 1: 50 tabs to read. Day 2: 10 meetings. Day 3:
  "Jump in!" Week 2: Overwhelmed, context-less, making mistakes that
  existing docs would have prevented - if they'd found them. New hire
  feels incompetent. The setup failed them.
  
### **Why**
  Information exists but the path through it doesn't. Onboarding often
  dumps everything at once instead of sequencing learning. New hires
