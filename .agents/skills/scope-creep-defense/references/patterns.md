## Patterns

  #### **Name**
The Scope Lock
  #### **Description**
Defining and protecting project boundaries
  #### **When To Use**
At project start and throughout
  #### **Implementation**
    ## Scope Lock Framework
    
    ### 1. The Scope Document
    
    ```markdown
    # Project Scope: [Name]
    
    ## In Scope
    - [Specific deliverable 1]
    - [Specific deliverable 2]
    - [Specific deliverable 3]
    
    ## Out of Scope
    - [Explicitly excluded 1]
    - [Explicitly excluded 2]
    - [Explicitly excluded 3]
    
    ## Success Criteria
    - [How we know we're done]
    
    ## Change Process
    - All scope changes require [approval]
    - Trade-offs must be identified
    ```
    
    ### 2. Boundary Markers
    
    | Include | Exclude |
    |---------|---------|
    | Core value prop | Nice-to-haves |
    | Must-have for MVP | Can wait |
    | Unblocks users | Delights users |
    | This release | Future release |
    
    ### 3. Scope Audit
    
    ```
    For each requirement:
    
    □ Is this in the scope doc?
    □ Does this enable core value?
    □ Could we ship without it?
    □ What gets pushed if we add it?
    ```
    
    ### 4. Lock Maintenance
    
    | Trigger | Action |
    |---------|--------|
    | New request | Check against scope |
    | "Small addition" | Apply same rigor |
    | Pressure | Reference scope doc |
    | Real need found | Formal change request |

  #### **Name**
The Diplomatic No
  #### **Description**
Declining requests without burning bridges
  #### **When To Use**
When you need to reject a feature request
  #### **Implementation**
    ## Saying No Gracefully
    
    ### 1. The No Template
    
    ```
    "I understand why you want [X], it would [benefit].
    
    Right now, we're focused on [current scope] because
    [reason]. Adding [X] would mean [trade-off].
    
    Could we [alternative]?"
    ```
    
    ### 2. No Variations
    
    | Type | Response |
    |------|----------|
    | Not now | "Let's add it to the backlog for after [milestone]" |
    | Not this | "What if we solved [underlying need] with [simpler solution]?" |
    | Not ever | "This conflicts with [principle]. Here's what we could do instead." |
    | Not us | "This might be better handled by [other team/tool]" |
    
    ### 3. The Trade-Off Frame
    
    ```
    INSTEAD OF:
    "No, we can't add that"
    
    SAY:
    "We can add that. What should we remove to make room?"
    "If we add X, Y will slip by two weeks. Is that OK?"
    ```
    
    ### 4. Request Reframing
    
    | What they say | What they need |
    |---------------|----------------|
    | "Add export to Excel" | Get data out somehow |
    | "Build mobile app" | Access on the go |
    | "Add user roles" | Some access control |
    | "Integrate with X" | Data in one place |

  #### **Name**
Priority Triage
  #### **Description**
Ruthlessly prioritizing requirements
  #### **When To Use**
When backlog is overwhelming
  #### **Implementation**
    ## Priority Triage
    
    ### 1. The MoSCoW Method
    
    | Priority | Meaning |
    |----------|---------|
    | Must | Ship fails without it |
    | Should | Important but survivable |
    | Could | Nice to have |
    | Won't | Not this release |
    
    ### 2. The Value/Effort Matrix
    
    ```
              HIGH VALUE
                  │
      QUICK WINS  │  BIG BETS
      (Do first)  │  (Plan carefully)
    ──────────────┼──────────────
      FILL-INS    │  MONEY PITS
      (If time)   │  (Avoid)
                  │
              LOW VALUE
        LOW EFFORT ───── HIGH EFFORT
    ```
    
    ### 3. The Stack Rank
    
    ```
    Force rank ALL requirements:
    
    1. [Most important]
    2. [Second most]
    3. [Third most]
    ...
    n. [Least important]
    
    Draw the line: "Above = in, Below = out"
    
    NO TIES ALLOWED.
    ```
    
    ### 4. The Cut Test
    
    | Question | If No |
    |----------|-------|
    | Does this enable core value? | Cut it |
    | Would users notice if missing? | Cut it |
    | Is this blocking other work? | Cut it |
    | Is this commitment (legal, etc.)? | Keep it |

  #### **Name**
Change Control
  #### **Description**
Managing scope changes formally
  #### **When To Use**
When change is truly needed
  #### **Implementation**
    ## Change Control Process
    
    ### 1. Change Request Form
    
    ```markdown
    ## Change Request
    
    **Requested by:** [Name]
    **Date:** [Date]
    
    **Change Description:**
    [What specifically is being requested]
    
    **Justification:**
    [Why this is needed NOW]
    
    **Impact if NOT done:**
    [What happens without it]
    
    **Trade-off Accepted:**
    [What will slip/be cut]
    
    **Approval:** [ ] Approved [ ] Denied
    ```
    
    ### 2. Impact Assessment
    
    | Factor | Assessment |
    |--------|------------|
    | Timeline impact | + [X] days/weeks |
    | Resource impact | [Who] diverted from [what] |
    | Quality impact | [What gets less attention] |
    | Scope trade-off | [What gets cut] |
    
    ### 3. Approval Levels
    
    | Change Size | Approver |
    |-------------|----------|
    | Tiny (< 1 day) | Tech lead |
    | Small (1-3 days) | PM + Tech lead |
    | Medium (1-2 weeks) | Director |
    | Large (> 2 weeks) | Stakeholder committee |
    
    ### 4. Communication
    
    ```
    WHEN APPROVED:
    
    "We're adding [X]. This means:
     - [Y] will be delayed by [Z]
     - Or [A] will be cut from this release
    
     This is documented in [link]."
    ```
