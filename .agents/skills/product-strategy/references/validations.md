product-feature-list
### **Severity**
error
### **Type**
regex
### **Pattern**
  - features.?include|will.?have|functionality|capabilities|includes

Focus on outcomes: What can users achieve? What jobs does this help them do? Why does it matter?
### **Applies To**

  - *.txt

warning

### **Message**
Building features because competitors have them. Copying is not strategy. It's the opposite of differentiation.

Ask: Does this solve OUR users' problem uniquely? Or are we just following? Lead, don't follow.
### **Applies To**
  - *.md
  - *.txt

### **Id**
product-no-validation
### **Severity**
error
### **Type**
regex

Trying to do everything. Products that do everything serve no one well. What is your core value?

### **Severity**
warning
### **Type**
regex
### **Pattern**

### **Message**
No tradeoffs mentioned. Every product decision is a tradeoff. What are you optimizing for? What are you sacrificing?

### **Severity**
warning
### **Type**
regex
### **Pattern**

### **Message**
Technology-first thinking. Users don't care about your tech stack. They care about their problems solved.
