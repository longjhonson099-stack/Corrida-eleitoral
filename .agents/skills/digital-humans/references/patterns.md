  #### **Name**
Avatar Selection for Trust
  #### **Description**
Match avatar characteristics to content requirements
  #### **When**
Choosing which avatar to use for a project
  #### **Example**
    TRUST FACTORS by content type:
    
    Financial/Legal content:
    - Older avatars (35-55) project experience
    - Conservative dress
    - Slower, measured delivery
    - Direct eye contact
    
    Consumer/Lifestyle content:
    - Avatars matching target demographic
    - Casual dress appropriate to brand
    - Warmer, more animated delivery
    - Friendly expressions
    
    Technical/Tutorial content:
    - Expert-coded appearance (glasses help, oddly)
    - Clean, simple backgrounds
    - Moderate pace for comprehension
    - Neutral, clear delivery
    
    DIVERSITY CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Match avatar to audience when possible
    - Rotate avatars for content series
    - Consider cultural context for global content
    - Avoid stereotyping

  #### **Name**
Script Optimization for AI Delivery
  #### **Description**
Write scripts that AI avatars deliver naturally
  #### **When**
Writing content for digital human presentation
  #### **Example**
    SCRIPT RULES for natural AI delivery:
    
    1. SHORT SENTENCES: AI handles short sentences better
       Bad: "In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll explore..."
       Good: "Let's learn how this works."
    
    2. NATURAL PAUSES: Use periods and commas for pacing
       Mark pauses with: "..." or [pause]
    
    3. PRONUNCIATION GUIDES: Spell unusual words phonetically
       "Azure" → "AZH-ure"
       "Kubernetes" → "Koo-ber-NET-eez"
    
    4. AVOID TONGUE TWISTERS: Simplify complex phrases
       Bad: "Six specific statistics show..."
       Good: "These six numbers show..."
    
    5. EMOTIONAL MARKERS: Mark tone changes
       [enthusiastic] "This is exciting!"
       [serious] "This matters."
    
    6. TEST BEFORE SCALE: Generate one video, listen, revise script

  #### **Name**
Personalization at Scale
  #### **Description**
Create thousands of personalized videos efficiently
  #### **When**
Needing personalized outreach, onboarding, or messaging
  #### **Example**
    PERSONALIZATION VARIABLES:
    
    1. NAME: "Hi [First Name]!"
       - Most basic, highest impact
       - Verify pronunciation with test generation
    
    2. COMPANY: "I noticed you work at [Company]"
       - Research-feel without being creepy
       - Great for sales outreach
    
    3. ROLE: "As a [Job Title], you probably..."
       - Shows relevance understanding
       - Tailor content to role
    
    4. CUSTOM CONTENT: "Based on your interest in [Topic]..."
       - Deepest personalization
       - Requires good data
    
    WORKFLOW:
    1. Create master script with variable placeholders
    2. Generate test with sample data
    3. Verify variable handling and pronunciation
    4. Batch generate with data file
    5. QA sample before sending all
    
    TAVUS: Best for variable-heavy personalization
    HEYGEN: Good for simpler personalization

  #### **Name**
Multi-Language Production
  #### **Description**
Create content in multiple languages efficiently
  #### **When**
Global content distribution needed
  #### **Example**
    OPTION 1: Same avatar, different language
    - Most consistent
    - May feel inauthentic (American avatar speaking Japanese)
    - Best for: Subtitled content, internal communications
    
    OPTION 2: Different avatar per language
    - Most natural
    - Requires multiple productions
    - Best for: Customer-facing, localized content
    
    OPTION 3: Voice-only localization
    - Same avatar with dubbed audio
    - Good middle ground
    - Best for: Budget-conscious global content
    
    WORKFLOW:
    1. Create master in primary language
    2. Translate script (human review essential)
    3. Select avatars per market or use consistent global avatar
    4. Generate all language versions
    5. Native speaker review before publishing
    
    WATCH FOR:
    - Lip sync quality varies by language
    - Some languages need longer scripts (German vs English)
    - Cultural gestures may not translate

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Deceptive Framing
  #### **Description**
Presenting AI avatars as real humans
  #### **Why**
Destroys trust when discovered; ethical issues
  #### **Instead**
Be transparent. "Powered by AI" or similar disclosure.

---
  #### **Name**
Uncanny Valley Blindness
  #### **Description**
Ignoring quality issues because you're used to them
  #### **Why**
Fresh viewers notice what you've stopped seeing
  #### **Instead**
Fresh eyes review. Ask "would this feel real to someone who hasn't seen 100 AI videos?"

---
  #### **Name**
Script Complexity
  #### **Description**
Writing scripts as if human was delivering
  #### **Why**
AI handles complex sentences poorly; unnatural delivery
  #### **Instead**
Short sentences. Simple words. Natural pauses.

---
  #### **Name**
Single Take Shipping
  #### **Description**
Using first generation without alternatives
  #### **Why**
Generation quality varies; some takes are better than others
  #### **Instead**
Generate 2-3 versions. Select best. Especially for hero content.

---
  #### **Name**
Ignoring Audio Sync
  #### **Description**
Not checking lip sync quality before publishing
  #### **Why**
Visible lip sync issues destroy believability instantly
  #### **Instead**
Watch without sound first—does the mouth movement look right?

---
  #### **Name**
Wrong Avatar for Audience
  #### **Description**
Choosing avatar without considering audience perception
  #### **Why**
Trust and relatability depend on avatar/audience match
  #### **Instead**
Consider age, appearance, and cultural factors for your specific audience.
