## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Vanity Dashboard
  #### **Description**
Tracking metrics that look good but don't matter
  #### **Why Bad**
    Big numbers feel good, hide problems.
    Wrong metrics drive wrong behavior.
    Miss actual issues.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Focus on outcomes over outputs.
    Track depth, not just breadth.
    Tie metrics to member value.

  #### **Name**
Data Without Action
  #### **Description**
Collecting data but not using it
  #### **Why Bad**
    Wasted effort collecting.
    False sense of being data-driven.
    Data grows stale and irrelevant.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Every metric should drive a decision.
    Regular data reviews with action items.
    Stop tracking what you don't use.
