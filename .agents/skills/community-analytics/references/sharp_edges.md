## Vanity Metrics Trap

### **Id**
vanity-metrics-trap
### **Summary**
Optimizing for wrong metrics
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
Growing member count while health declines
### **Why**
  Easy metrics are often wrong metrics.
  Leadership asks for simple numbers.
  Growth is visible, health is not.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Avoiding Vanity Metrics
  
  ### Vanity vs Value
  | Vanity | Value |
  |--------|-------|
  | Total members | Active members |
  | Total messages | Conversations |
  | Page views | Time engaged |
  | Followers | Engagement rate |
  
  ### Reporting Balance
  Always pair growth with health:
  - "500 new members, 45% week-1 retention"
  - "10K messages, 3.2 avg thread depth"
  - "20K followers, 5% engagement rate"
  
  ### Executive Dashboard
  - Lead with health, not just growth
  - Show trends, not just snapshots
  - Include qualitative alongside quantitative
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Big numbers, declining engagement
  - Leadership happy, team worried
  - Can't explain business value
### **Detection Pattern**
numbers look good|but engagement|vanity|meaningless
