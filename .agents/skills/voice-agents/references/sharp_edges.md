# Voice Agents - Sharp Edges

## Response Latency Exceeds 800ms

### **Id**
latency-kills-conversation
### **Severity**
critical
### **Situation**
Building a voice agent pipeline
### **Symptom**
  Conversations feel awkward. Users repeat themselves. "Are you
  there?" questions. Users hang up or give up. Low satisfaction
  scores despite correct answers.
  
### **Why**
  In human conversation, responses typically arrive within 500ms.
  Anything over 800ms feels like the agent is slow or confused.
  Users lose confidence and patience. Every component adds latency:
  VAD (100ms) + STT (200ms) + LLM (300ms) + TTS (200ms) = 800ms.
  
### **Solution**
  # Measure and budget latency for each component:
  
  ## Target latencies:
  - VAD processing: <100ms
  - STT time-to-first-token: <200ms
  - LLM time-to-first-token: <300ms
  - TTS time-to-first-audio: <150ms
  - Total end-to-end: <800ms
  
  ## Optimization strategies:
  
  1. Use low-latency models:
     - STT: Deepgram Nova-3 (150ms) vs Whisper (500ms+)
     - TTS: ElevenLabs Flash (75ms) vs standard (200ms+)
     - LLM: gpt-4o-mini streaming
  
  2. Stream everything:
     - Don't wait for full STT transcript
     - Stream LLM output to TTS
     - Start audio playback before TTS finishes
  
  3. Pre-compute:
     - While user speaks, prepare context
     - Generate opening phrase in parallel
  
  4. Edge deployment:
     - Run VAD/STT at edge
     - Use nearest cloud region
  
  ## Measure continuously:
  Log timestamps at each stage, track P50/P95 latency
  
### **Detection Pattern**
  - latency
  - slow
  - delay
  - timeout

## Response Time Variance Disrupts Rhythm

### **Id**
jitter-worse-than-latency
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
Voice agent with inconsistent response times
### **Symptom**
  Conversations feel unpredictable. User doesn't know when to speak.
  Sometimes agent responds immediately, sometimes after long pause.
  Users talk over agent. Agent talks over users.
  
### **Why**
  Jitter (variance in response time) disrupts conversational rhythm
  more than absolute latency. Consistent 800ms feels better than
  alternating 400ms and 1200ms. Users can't adapt to unpredictable
  timing.
  
### **Solution**
  # Target jitter metrics:
  - Standard deviation: <100ms
  - P95-P50 gap: <200ms
  
  ## Reduce jitter sources:
  
  1. Consistent model loading:
     - Keep models warm
     - Pre-load on connection start
  
  2. Buffer audio output:
     - Small buffer (50-100ms) smooths playback
     - Don't start playing until buffer filled
  
  3. Handle LLM variance:
     - gpt-4o-mini more consistent than larger models
     - Set max_tokens to limit long responses
  
  4. Monitor and alert:
     - Track response time distribution
     - Alert on jitter spikes
  
  ## Implementation:
  const MIN_RESPONSE_TIME = 400;  // ms
  
  async function respondWithConsistentTiming(text) {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    const audio = await generateSpeech(text);
  
    const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
    if (elapsed < MIN_RESPONSE_TIME) {
      await delay(MIN_RESPONSE_TIME - elapsed);
    }
  
    playAudio(audio);
  }
  
### **Detection Pattern**
  - jitter
  - variance
  - inconsistent
  - timing

## Using Silence Duration for Turn Detection

### **Id**
silence-only-vad
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
Detecting when user finishes speaking
### **Symptom**
  Agent interrupts user mid-thought. Or waits too long after user
  finishes. "Let me think..." triggers premature response. Short
  answers have awkward pause before response.
  
### **Why**
  Simple silence detection (e.g., "end turn after 500ms silence")
  doesn't understand conversation. Humans pause mid-sentence.
  "Yes." needs fast response, "Well, let me think about that..."
  needs patience. Fixed timeout fits neither.
  
### **Solution**
  # Use semantic VAD:
  
  ## OpenAI Semantic VAD:
  client.updateSession({
    turn_detection: {
      type: 'semantic_vad',
      // Waits longer after "umm..."
      // Responds faster after "Yes, that's correct."
    },
  });
  
  ## Pipecat SmartTurn:
  const pipeline = new Pipeline({
    vad: new SileroVAD(),
    turnDetection: new SmartTurn(),
  });
  
  // SmartTurn considers:
  // - Speech content (complete sentence?)
  // - Prosody (falling intonation?)
  // - Context (question asked?)
  
  ## Fallback: Adaptive silence threshold:
  function calculateSilenceThreshold(transcript) {
    const endsWithComplete = transcript.match(/[.!?]$/);
    const hasFillers = transcript.match(/um|uh|like|well/i);
  
    if (endsWithComplete && !hasFillers) {
      return 300;  // Fast response
    } else if (hasFillers) {
      return 1500;  // Wait for continuation
    }
    return 700;  // Default
  }
  
### **Detection Pattern**

  - turn

## Agent Doesn't Stop When User Interrupts

### **Id**
no-barge-in-handling
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
User tries to interrupt agent mid-sentence
### **Symptom**
  Agent talks over user. User has to wait for agent to finish.
  Frustrating experience. Users give up and abandon call.
  "STOP! STOP!" doesn't work.
  
### **Why**
  Without barge-in handling, the TTS plays to completion regardless
  of user input. This violates basic conversational norms - in human
  conversation, we stop when interrupted.
  
### **Solution**
  # Implement barge-in detection:
  
  ## Basic barge-in:
  vad.on('speech_start', () => {
    if (ttsPlayer.isPlaying) {
      // 1. Stop audio immediately
      ttsPlayer.stop();
  
      // 2. Cancel pending TTS generation
      ttsController.abort();
  
      // 3. Checkpoint conversation state
      conversationState.save();
  
      // 4. Listen to new input
      startTranscription();
    }
  });
  
  ## Advanced: Distinguish interruption types:
  vad.on('speech_start', async () => {
    if (!ttsPlayer.isPlaying) return;
  
    // Wait 200ms to get first words
    await delay(200);
    const firstWords = getTranscriptSoFar();
  
    if (isBackchannel(firstWords)) {
      // "uh-huh", "yeah" - don't interrupt
      return;
    }
  
    if (isClarification(firstWords)) {
      // "What?", "Sorry?" - repeat last sentence
      repeatLastSentence();
    } else {
      // Real interruption - stop and listen
      handleFullInterruption();
    }
  });
  
  ## Response time target:
  - Barge-in response: <200ms
  - User should feel heard immediately
  
### **Detection Pattern**
  - interrupt
  - barge
  - stop
  - playing

## Generating Text-Length Responses for Voice

### **Id**
long-responses-for-voice
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Prompting LLM for voice agent responses
### **Symptom**
  Agent rambles. Users lose track of information. "Can you repeat
  that?" requests. Users interrupt to ask for shorter version.
  Low comprehension of conveyed information.
  
### **Why**
  Text can be scanned and re-read. Voice is linear and ephemeral.
  A 3-paragraph response that works in chat is overwhelming in voice.
  Users can only hold ~7 items in working memory.
  
### **Solution**
  # Constrain response length in prompts:
  
  system_prompt = '''
  You are a voice assistant. Keep responses UNDER 30 WORDS.
  For complex information, break into chunks and confirm
  understanding between each.
  
  Instead of: "Here are the three options. First, you could...
  Second... Third..."
  
  Say: "I found 3 options. Want me to go through them?"
  
  Never list more than 3 items without pausing for confirmation.
  '''
  
  ## Enforce at generation:
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    max_tokens: 100,  // Hard limit
    // ...
  });
  
  ## Chunking pattern:
  if (information.length > 3) {
    response = `I have ${information.length} items. Let's go through them one at a time. First: ${information[0]}. Ready for the next?`;
  }
  
  ## Progressive disclosure:
  "I found your account. Want the balance, recent transactions, or something else?"
  // Don't dump all info at once
  
### **Detection Pattern**
  - voice
  - response
  - length
  - prompt

## Using Bullets/Numbers/Markdown in Voice

### **Id**
text-formatting-in-voice
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Formatting LLM output for voice
### **Symptom**
  "First bullet point: item one" read aloud. Numbers read as "one
  two three" instead of "one, two, three." Markdown artifacts in
  speech. Robotic, unnatural delivery.
  
### **Why**
  TTS models read what they're given. Text formatting intended for
  visual display sounds robotic when read aloud. Users can't "see"
  structure in audio.
  
### **Solution**
  # Prompt for spoken format:
  
  system_prompt = '''
  Format responses for SPOKEN delivery:
  - No bullet points, numbered lists, or markdown
  - Spell out numbers: "twenty-three" not "23"
  - Spell out abbreviations: "United States" not "US"
  - Use verbal signposting: "There are three things. First..."
  - Never use asterisks, dashes, or special characters
  '''
  
  ## Post-processing:
  function prepareForSpeech(text) {
    return text
      // Remove markdown
      .replace(/[*_#`]/g, '')
      // Convert numbers
      .replace(/\d+/g, numToWords)
      // Expand abbreviations
      .replace(/\betc\b/gi, 'et cetera')
      .replace(/\be\.g\./gi, 'for example')
      // Add pauses
      .replace(/\. /g, '... ')
      .replace(/, /g, '... ');
  }
  
  ## SSML for precise control:
  <speak>
    The total is <say-as interpret-as="currency">$49.99</say-as>.
    <break time="500ms"/>
    Want to proceed?
  </speak>

## VAD/STT Fails in Noisy Environments

### **Id**
no-noise-handling
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Users in cars, cafes, outdoors
### **Symptom**
  "I didn't catch that" frequently. Background noise triggers
  false starts. Fan/AC causes continuous listening. Car engine
  noise confuses STT.
  
### **Why**
  Default VAD thresholds work for quiet environments. Real-world
  usage includes background noise that triggers false positives
  or masks speech, causing false negatives.
  
### **Solution**
  # Implement noise handling:
  
  ## 1. Noise reduction in STT:
  const transcription = await deepgram.transcription.live({
    model: 'nova-3',
    noise_reduction: true,
    // or
    smart_format: true,
  });
  
  ## 2. Adaptive VAD threshold:
  // Measure ambient noise level
  const ambientLevel = measureAmbientNoise(5000);  // 5 sec sample
  
  vad.setThreshold(ambientLevel * 1.5);  // Above ambient
  
  ## 3. Confidence filtering:
  stt.on('transcript', (data) => {
    if (data.confidence < 0.7) {
      // Low confidence - probably noise
      askForRepeat();
      return;
    }
    processTranscript(data.transcript);
  });
  
  ## 4. Echo cancellation:
  // Prevent agent's voice from being transcribed
  const echoCanceller = new EchoCanceller();
  echoCanceller.reference(ttsOutput);
  const cleanedAudio = echoCanceller.process(userAudio);
  
### **Detection Pattern**
  - noise
  - background
  - didn't catch
  - confidence

## STT Produces Incorrect or Hallucinated Text

### **Id**
stt-hallucination
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Processing unclear or accented speech
### **Symptom**
  Agent responds to something user didn't say. Names consistently
  wrong. Technical terms misheard. "I said X, not Y" frustration.
  
### **Why**
  STT models can hallucinate, especially on proper nouns, technical
  terms, or accented speech. These errors propagate through the
  pipeline and produce nonsensical responses.
  
### **Solution**
  # Mitigate STT errors:
  
  ## 1. Use keywords/biasing:
  const transcription = await deepgram.transcription.live({
    keywords: ['Acme Corp', 'ProductName', 'John Smith'],
    keyword_boost: 'high',
  });
  
  ## 2. Confirmation for critical info:
  if (containsNameOrNumber(transcript)) {
    response = `I heard "${name}". Is that correct?`;
  }
  
  ## 3. Confidence-based fallback:
  if (confidence < 0.8) {
    response = `I think you said "${transcript}". Did I get that right?`;
  }
  
  ## 4. Multiple hypothesis handling:
  // Some STT APIs return n-best list
  const alternatives = transcription.alternatives;
  if (alternatives[0].confidence - alternatives[1].confidence < 0.1) {
    // Ambiguous - ask for clarification
  }
  
  ## 5. Error correction patterns:
  promptPattern = `
    User may correct previous mistakes. If they say "no, I said X"
    or "not Y, Z", update your understanding accordingly.
  `;
  
### **Detection Pattern**
  - transcript
  - said
  - heard
  - confidence
