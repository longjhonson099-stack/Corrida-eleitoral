# Vehicle Design - Validations

## Vehicle Proportion Check

### **Id**
proportion-verification
### **Severity**
critical
### **Type**
checklist
### **Description**
  Verify all fundamental proportions before proceeding to detail work.
  Bad proportions cannot be fixed with detail - they must be caught early.
  
### **When**
Before any surface detail work begins
### **Checklist**
  - Wheel diameter is correct for vehicle type (35-45% of body height for sports)
  - Wheelbase ratio matches archetype (55-65% of total length)
  - Ground clearance is intentional and appropriate
  - Cabin/glasshouse proportions feel balanced
  - Front and rear overhangs are intentional
  - Vehicle compared to real reference at same scale
  - Proportions reviewed from front, side, rear, and 3/4 views
### **Fix Action**
Revise basic volumes and proportions before proceeding
### **Approval Gate**


## Silhouette Readability Test

### **Id**
silhouette-test
### **Severity**
critical
### **Type**
checklist
### **Description**
  Verify the vehicle reads clearly at small sizes and distances.
  The silhouette should communicate vehicle type without any detail.
  
### **When**
After basic form is established
### **Checklist**
  - Vehicle type is identifiable at 100 pixel width
  - Silhouette is distinct from other vehicles in the project
  - Key features (spoiler, cab, turret) read in silhouette
  - Squint test passed - major masses are clear
  - Silhouette works from all major viewing angles
  - Day/night silhouette readability considered
### **Fix Action**
Strengthen silhouette by exaggerating key proportions and features
### **Approval Gate**


## Vehicle Stance Assessment

### **Id**
stance-evaluation
### **Severity**
high
### **Type**
checklist
### **Description**
  Verify the vehicle's stance communicates intended character.
  Stance is how the vehicle "sits" - its attitude and personality.

### **Fix Action**
Adjust wheel position, ride height, and rake to match intended character

## Wheel and Tire Design Verification

### **Id**
wheel-design-audit
### **Severity**
high
### **Type**
checklist
### **Description**
  Verify wheels are correctly sized, styled, and detailed.
  Wheels are 30-40% of what makes a vehicle design work.
  
### **When**
When wheel design is completed
### **Checklist**
  - Wheel diameter is correct for vehicle archetype
  - Tire sidewall ratio matches vehicle type (low for sports, high for off-road)
  - Spoke design matches vehicle character
  - Brake visibility appropriate for performance level

Redesign wheels to match vehicle character and archetype

## Functional Element Verification

### **Id**
functional-aesthetic-check
### **Severity**
high
### **Type**
checklist
### **Description**
  Verify all surface details have functional justification.
  Every vent, intake, and panel line should have a reason to exist.
  
### **When**
After surface detailing
### **Checklist**
  - Every intake has implied airflow destination
  - Every vent has implied heat/exhaust source
  - Panel lines correspond to assembly, access, or style
  - Aerodynamic elements are placed logically

### **Id**
steering-clearance-check
### **Severity**
critical
### **Type**
checklist

## Scale Reference Inclusion

### **Id**
scale-reference-verification
### **Severity**
high
### **Type**
checklist
### **Description**
  Verify human scale reference is included in design documentation.
  Without scale reference, 3D modelers cannot size the vehicle correctly.
  
### **When**
Before concept approval
### **Checklist**
  - Human figure included in at least one concept view
  - Door/entry height indicates human access
  - Cockpit/cabin sized for intended occupants
  - Dimensions noted in meters or feet

### **Severity**
medium
### **Type**
checklist
### **Description**
