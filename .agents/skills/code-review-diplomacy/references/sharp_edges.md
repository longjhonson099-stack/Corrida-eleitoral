  2. SMALLER PRs

  3. PR ROULETTE
     Automate reviewer assignment
  
  4. REVIEW TIME
     Block calendar for reviews
  ```

  | Show Value By | How |
  |---------------|-----|

  | Teaching | Juniors learn from feedback |
  | Sharing knowledge | Spread context |
  | Improving quality | Metric improvements |
  
  ### Culture Shift
  
  ```
  OLD MINDSET:
  "Review is a gate to pass"

## Bikeshedding

### **Id**
bikeshedding
### **Summary**
Spending review time on trivial issues
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Big issues ignored while style debated
### **Why**
  Easy to have opinions on style.
  Hard to catch real bugs.
  No priority guidance.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Focusing Review on What Matters
  
  ### The Bikeshed Problem
  
  ```
  WHAT HAPPENS:
  20 comments on variable names
  0 comments on the race condition
  
  WHY:
  - Style is easy to see
  - Bugs are hard to find
  - Opinions on style are cheap
  ```
  
  ### Review Priority Ladder
  
  | Priority | Focus Area |
  |----------|------------|
  | 1. Critical | Security, data loss, crashes |
  | 2. Important | Logic errors, edge cases |
  | 3. Moderate | Performance, maintainability |
  | 4. Minor | Style, naming, formatting |
  
  ### Process Fixes
  
  | Problem | Solution |
  |---------|----------|
  | Style debates | Auto-formatter (Prettier, etc.) |
  | Naming debates | Conventions doc |
  | Trivial comments | Use [nit] prefix |
  | Missing priorities | Review checklist |
  
  ### The Checklist Approach
  
  ```markdown
  ## Review Checklist
  
  Before commenting on style, verify:
  
  - [ ] No security issues
  - [ ] No data corruption risk
  - [ ] Error handling exists
  - [ ] Tests cover new code
  - [ ] No obvious bugs
  
  THEN worry about naming.
  ```
  
  ### Comment Quota
  
  ```
  RULE OF THUMB:
  
  For every [nit], require yourself to:
  - Look for one actual bug
  - Or leave one genuine praise
  
  Keeps focus on what matters.
  ```
  
### **Symptoms**
  - 50 comments, all style
  - Production bugs post-merge
  - Reviews take forever on trivial
  - Author frustration
### **Detection Pattern**
should rename|formatting|style|whitespace
