# Easter Egg Design - Sharp Edges

## Maintenance Burden

### **Id**
maintenance-burden
### **Summary**
Easter eggs that become technical debt
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Hidden features that break or need constant updates
### **Why**
  Forgotten in refactors.
  Dependencies change.
  No one owns them.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Sustainable Easter Eggs
  
  ### Design for Longevity
  
  ```
  Easter egg architecture:
  
  1. ISOLATION
     - Separate from core code
     - Own module/component
     - Clear boundaries
  
  2. SIMPLICITY
     - Minimal dependencies
     - Self-contained logic
     - Simple triggers
  
  3. DOCUMENTATION
     - Document existence
     - Document triggers
     - Document owners
  ```
  
  ### Maintenance Checklist
  
  | Check | Frequency |
  |-------|-----------|
  | Still working? | Every release |
  | References current? | Quarterly |
  | Owner assigned? | Yearly |
  | Worth keeping? | Yearly |
  
  ### Graceful Degradation
  
  ```
  If easter egg breaks:
  
  Option A: Fix it (if worth it)
  Option B: Remove cleanly (if not)
  Option C: Degrade gracefully (show nothing)
  
  Never: Leave broken
  ```
  
  ### Technical Patterns
  
  | Pattern | Benefit |
  |---------|---------|
  | Feature flag | Easy to disable |
  | Lazy loading | No core impact |
  | Time limit | Natural sunset |
  | Fallback | Breaks silently |
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Broken easter eggs in production
  - No one knows how it works
  - Blocks refactoring
### **Detection Pattern**
broken easter egg|who owns this|can we remove

## Accessibility Failure

### **Id**
accessibility-failure
### **Summary**
Easter eggs that exclude users
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
Discovery requires abilities some users don't have
### **Why**
  Designed for one input method.
  Visual-only reveals.
  Timing requirements.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Accessible Easter Eggs
  
  ### Inclusive Discovery
  
  | Barrier | Solution |
  |---------|----------|
  | Mouse-only trigger | Add keyboard equivalent |
  | Visual-only reward | Add audio/text |
  | Timing-dependent | Allow flexible timing |
  | Color-dependent | Use patterns/text too |
  
  ### Multiple Paths
  
  ```
  Good easter egg:
  
  Trigger options:
  - Click logo 5 times OR
  - Press Ctrl+Alt+E OR
  - Type "surprise" anywhere
  
  Multiple ways in = more inclusive.
  ```
  
  ### Reward Accessibility
  
  | Reward Type | Accessibility |
  |-------------|---------------|
  | Visual only | Add alt text, aria |
  | Audio only | Add captions, visual |
  | Motion | Provide static option |
  | Game | Ensure keyboard playable |
  
  ### Testing Checklist
  
  ```
  Before shipping:
  
  □ Works with keyboard only?
  □ Works with screen reader?
  □ No timing requirements?
  □ Color-blind friendly?
  □ Doesn't trigger seizures?
  ```
  
### **Symptoms**
  - I couldn't access it
  - Relies on specific abilities
  - Excludes user segments
### **Detection Pattern**

## Cultural Misfire

### **Id**
cultural-misfire
### **Summary**
References that don't translate across cultures
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Easter egg relies on culture-specific knowledge
### **Why**
  Pop culture isn't universal.
  References age quickly.
  Humor doesn't translate.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Universal Delight
  
  ### Culture-Safe Categories
  
  | Safe | Risky |
  |------|-------|
  | Universal humor | Country-specific |
  | Visual gags | Language puns |
  | Math/logic puzzles | Cultural references |
  | Product self-reference | Pop culture |
  | Animal cuteness | Regional memes |
  
  ### Reference Lifespan
  
  | Reference Type | Lifespan |
  |----------------|----------|
  | Classic (Star Wars) | Decades |
  | Current trend | Months |
  | Meme | Weeks to months |
  | News | Days |
  
  ### Global Testing
  
  ```
  Before shipping:
  
  1. Test with diverse users
  2. Check if reference translates
  3. Verify no offensive meanings
  4. Consider all markets
  
  When in doubt, go universal.
  ```
  
  ### Localization Strategy
  
  | Approach | Pros | Cons |
  |----------|------|------|
  | Universal | Works everywhere | Less targeted |
  | Localized | More relevant | More work |
  | Market-specific | Deep resonance | Limited reach |
  
### **Symptoms**
  - I don't get it
  - Works in US only
  - Offensive in some cultures
### **Detection Pattern**

## Discovery Exploitation

### **Id**
discovery-exploitation
### **Summary**
Users gaming discovery for rewards
### **Severity**
low
### **Situation**
Easter eggs with valuable rewards get exploited
### **Why**
  Rewards too valuable.
  Easy to share method.
  Undermines specialness.
  
### **Solution**
  ## Reward Calibration
  
  ### Value Tiers
  
  | Reward Value | Discovery Difficulty |
  |--------------|---------------------|
  | High (features) | Very hidden |
  | Medium (cosmetic) | Moderate |
  | Low (fun only) | Easy to find |
  
  ### Exploitation Prevention
  
  ```
  For valuable rewards:
  
  1. Rate limit (once per user)
  2. Require account
  3. Time-gate availability
  4. Make discovery personal
  
  For fun rewards:
  Let them be found and shared!
  ```
  
  ### The Right Balance
  
  | If everyone knows | It's not special |
  | If no one knows | It's not found |
  | If some know | Perfect tension |
  
  ### Embrace Sharing
  
  ```
  Often, exploitation isn't bad:
  
  - Spreads word of mouth
  - Increases engagement
  - Shows product personality
  - Creates community moments
  
  Only protect if reward is truly valuable.
  ```
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Tutorials showing easter egg
  - Everyone knows immediately
  - Feels less special
### **Detection Pattern**
everyone knows|spoiled|too easy to find
