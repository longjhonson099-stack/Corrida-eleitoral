  #### **Name**
Discovery Design
  #### **Description**
How users find easter eggs
  #### **When To Use**
Engineering the discovery experience
  #### **Implementation**
    ## Discovery Mechanics
    
    ### 1. Discovery Methods
    
    | Method | How Found | Example |
    |--------|-----------|---------|
    | Accidental | Random user action | Clicking logo 7 times |
    | Curious | Exploring UI | Hidden menu item |
    | Informed | Hints or rumors | "Type this phrase" |
    | Social | Others share | Friend shows you |
    | Seasonal | Time-limited | Holiday appearance |
    
    ### 2. Discoverability Calibration
    
    ```
    Too Hidden                    Too Obvious
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Never found ← Sweet Spot → Not special
    
    Sweet spot factors:
    - Some people find naturally
    - Those who find share
    - Feels exclusive but findable
    - Hints exist if you look
    ```
    
    ### 3. Hint Design
    
    | Hint Level | Example |
    |------------|---------|
    | None | Pure exploration reward |
    | Subtle | Unusual UI element |
    | Moderate | Tooltip or hover text |
    | Explicit | "Try [action] for a surprise" |
    
    ### 4. Discovery Journey
    
    ```
    Ideal discovery arc:
    
    1. CURIOSITY
       "What happens if I..."
    
    2. EXPERIMENTATION
       Trying different things
    
    3. DISCOVERY
       The reveal moment
    
    4. DELIGHT
       Emotional payoff
    
    5. SHARING
       "You have to see this!"
    ```

  #### **When To Use**

  #### **Implementation**
    ## Shareability Design
    
    ### 1. Share Triggers
    
    ```
    People share when they feel:
    
    - Special (I found this!)
    - Generous (You'll love this!)
    - Smart (I figured it out!)
    - Connected (Remember this?)
    - Amused (This is hilarious!)
    ```
    
    ### 2. Share Format Optimization
    
    | Format | Shareability | Design For |
    |--------|--------------|------------|
    | Screenshot | High | Visual impact |
    | Video | Very high | Motion/sound |
    | Story | High | Memorable moment |
    | Demo | Highest | "Try this" |
    
    ### 3. Share-Friendly Features
    
    ```
    Make sharing easy:
    
    1. VISUAL CLARITY
       - Clear in screenshot
       - Works out of context
       - Interesting at a glance
    
    2. DEMONSTRABLE
       - Others can try it
       - Steps are simple
       - Works reliably
    
    3. CONTEXTUAL HOOK
       - "In [product], try..."
       - Clear what product is
       - Brand visible
    ```
    
    ### 4. Viral Easter Egg Anatomy
    
    | Element | Purpose |
    |---------|---------|
    | Discoverable | Some people find it |
    | Shareable | Format spreads easily |
    | Reproducible | Others can try it |
    | Delightful | Worth sharing |
    | On-brand | Reinforces product |
