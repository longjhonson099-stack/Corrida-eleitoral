  #### **When**
Starting any AI music generation project
  #### **Example**
    SUNO AI:
    - Best for: Songs with vocals, lyrics, full arrangements

  #### **Name**
Genre-Accurate Prompting
  #### **Description**
Prompt for specific musical genres with technical accuracy
  #### **When**
Generating music that must fit a specific genre
  #### **Example**
    Generic prompt (weak):
    "happy upbeat music"
    
    Genre-specific prompt (strong):
    "Upbeat indie pop, 120 BPM, acoustic guitar strumming,
    handclaps, tambourine, warm analog synth bass, breathy
    female vocals, summer festival vibes, Vampire Weekend
    meets HAIM production style"
    
    Key elements to specify:
    - BPM (tempo)
    - Key instruments
    - Production era/style
    - Reference artists (for vibe, not copying)
    - Mood and use case
    - Specific sonic characteristics
    
    The more specific, the more control.

  #### **Name**
The Reference Track Method
  #### **Description**
Use existing music as a launching point for AI generation
  #### **When**
You know the vibe you want but can't describe it
  #### **Example**
    Step 1: Find reference track that has the vibe you want
    Step 2: Analyze it:
      - Genre and subgenre
      - BPM (use tap tempo tool)
      - Key instruments
      - Production style (vintage, modern, lo-fi, polished)
      - Mood and energy curve
      - Vocal style (if applicable)
    
    Step 3: Translate to prompt:
    "Create a track inspired by [analysis], with [your modifications]"
    
    Step 4: Generate and compare to reference
    Step 5: Iterate on prompt to get closer
    
    Never use reference for copying—use for understanding vibe.

  #### **Name**
Sound Effect Generation
  #### **Description**
Create custom sound effects with AI
  #### **When**
Need specific SFX that don't exist in libraries
  #### **Example**
    Using ElevenLabs Sound Effects or similar:
    
    Describe the sound, not the action:
    Bad: "door closing"
    Good: "Heavy wooden door slamming shut with metallic latch
    click, slight reverb indicating large stone room"
    
    Include:
    - Material (wood, metal, glass, fabric)
    - Scale (small, large, massive)
    - Environment (reverb, echo, room tone)
    - Quality (clean, distorted, lo-fi)
    - Duration (short impact, sustained)
    
    Generate multiple variations. Layer in DAW for complexity.

  #### **Name**
Audio Branding Package
  #### **Description**
Create consistent audio identity for a brand
  #### **When**
Developing audio logo, hold music, notification sounds
  #### **Example**
    Audio brand elements:
    
    1. AUDIO LOGO (sonic logo): 3-5 second signature sound
       - Generate variations, select most memorable
       - Must work at all volumes, on all speakers
       - Often melodic, sometimes just textural
    
    2. HOLD MUSIC: Background for calls, loading screens
       - Generate in brand mood
       - Loop seamlessly (specify in prompt)
       - Low-key enough to not annoy
    
    3. NOTIFICATION SOUNDS: Alerts, confirmations, errors
       - Short (< 1 second)
       - Distinct but not jarring
       - Consistent sonic palette
    
    4. BACKGROUND MUSIC: Videos, content, spaces
       - Various energy levels (calm, medium, energetic)
       - Same sonic palette as audio logo
       - Generate stems for flexibility
    
    Create brand sound guide like visual brand guide.

  #### **Name**
Stem Separation and Remix
  #### **Description**
Deconstruct and reconstruct audio using AI
  #### **When**
Need to isolate or modify elements of existing audio
  #### **Example**
    Using LALAL.AI, Descript, or similar:
    
    1. SEPARATE: Upload audio → Extract stems
       - Vocals
       - Drums
       - Bass
       - Other instruments
       - Background noise
    
    2. MANIPULATE: Adjust individual elements
       - Remove vocals for instrumental
       - Isolate vocals for remix
       - Remove background noise from recordings
       - Extract dialogue from noisy source
    
    3. RECONSTRUCT: Combine with new elements
       - AI-generated music bed + extracted vocals
       - Original bass + AI-generated drums
       - Clean dialogue + AI-generated ambience
    
    Workflow: Traditional recording → AI separation →
    AI enhancement → Professional result

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Genre Vagueness
  #### **Description**
Using generic mood words instead of specific genre terms
  #### **Why**
AI models know genres; vague prompts get vague results
  #### **Instead**
Be specific. "90s trip-hop with vinyl crackle" not "chill music"

---
  #### **Name**
Ignoring Rights
  #### **Description**
Using AI music without understanding licensing
  #### **Why**
AI-generated music has varying license terms; some restrict commercial use
  #### **Instead**
Check platform license terms. Many require subscription for commercial use.

---
  #### **Name**
First Generation Shipping
  #### **Description**
Using the first generated track without iteration
  #### **Why**
AI music is probabilistic; first generation rarely optimal
  #### **Instead**
Generate 10+ versions. Select and refine. Extend/edit winners.

---
  #### **Name**
Ignoring Audio Quality
  #### **Description**
Not properly exporting or mastering AI audio
  #### **Why**
Raw AI output may need EQ, compression, limiting for broadcast
  #### **Instead**
Run through basic mastering chain. Match loudness standards.

---
  #### **Name**
Overcomplicating Prompts
  #### **Description**
Adding contradictory style elements
  #### **Why**
"Jazz rock electronic ambient classical" confuses models
  #### **Instead**
One or two complementary genres. Clear direction.

---
  #### **Name**
Skipping Human Review
  #### **Description**
Publishing AI audio without listening critically
  #### **Why**
AI audio can have artifacts, weird moments, quality issues
  #### **Instead**
Full playthrough before publishing. Edit out problem sections.
