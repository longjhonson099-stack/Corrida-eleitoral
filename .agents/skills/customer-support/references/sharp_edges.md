# Customer Support - Sharp Edges

## Ai Without Content

### **Id**
ai-without-content
### **Summary**
AI chatbots are useless without quality content
### **Severity**
critical
### **Tools Affected**
  - intercom-fin
  - ada
  - chatbase
  - tidio
### **Situation**
Deploying AI agent before building knowledge base
### **Why**
  AI chatbots work by finding relevant content and generating responses.
  No content = no good answers = frustrated customers.
  
  The AI is only as good as what you feed it.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Build comprehensive KB BEFORE enabling AI
  2. Cover top 50 questions thoroughly
  3. Include edge cases and exceptions
  4. Update content based on AI failures
  5. Monitor "I don't know" responses
  
### **Symptoms**
  - AI says 'I don't know' constantly
  - Wrong or generic answers
  - High escalation rate

## Per Resolution Cost Explosion

### **Id**
per-resolution-cost-explosion
### **Summary**
Per-resolution AI pricing can explode unexpectedly
### **Severity**
high
### **Tools Affected**
  - intercom-fin
### **Situation**
Enabling AI without understanding pricing model
### **Why**
  $0.99/resolution sounds cheap until:
  - Volume is higher than expected
  - Definition of "resolution" is broad
  - Simple queries still count
  - No volume discount
  
  Easy to 10x expected AI costs.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Understand exactly what counts as "resolution"
  2. Set spending limits/alerts
  3. Calculate expected volume realistically
  4. Compare to human agent cost
  5. Negotiate caps for high volume
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Unexpected AI charges
  - Cost per ticket higher than expected
  - Bill shock

## Ai Hallucination

### **Severity**
high
### **Tools Affected**
  - intercom-fin

### **Situation**
AI provides incorrect product/policy information
### **Why**
  Even the best AI can:
  - Mix up similar topics
  - Invent policies that don't exist
  - Give outdated information
  - Miss important exceptions
  
  Customers take AI answers as official.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Monitor AI conversations regularly

### **Severity**
high
### **Tools Affected**

### **Why**
  Nothing frustrates customers more than:
  - Repeating their problem
  - Agent not seeing AI conversation
  - Starting over from scratch
  - Long wait after AI failure
  
  Worse than no AI at all.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Full conversation context passes to agent

  Fast bad support is still bad support.
  
### **Solution**
