## Anti-Patterns

  #### **Name**
Feature Chasing
  #### **Description**
Choosing platform for features you won't use
  #### **Why Bad**
    Paying for unused features.
    More complex than needed.
    Harder to switch later.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    List features you NEED now.
    Ignore the rest.
    Choose simplest option that works.
    Upgrade later if needed.

  #### **Name**
Price-First Decision
  #### **Description**
Choosing cheapest option
  #### **Why Bad**
    Hidden costs emerge.
    Missing critical features.
    Limits growth.
    Migrating costs more than premium would have.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Calculate true cost at scale.
    Include transaction fees.
    Include opportunity cost.
    Think 2-3 years ahead.
    

---
  #### **Name**
Premature Custom Build
  #### **Description**
Building custom before validating
  #### **Why Bad**
    Months of development.
    Not sure course will sell.
    Technical debt before revenue.
    Could use that time to teach.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Use SaaS for v1.
    Validate demand.
    Build custom only if platform is limiting.
    Treat custom as v2 or v3.
