# Sales - Sharp Edges

## Domain Reputation Death

### **Id**
domain-reputation-death
### **Summary**
Cold email can destroy your domain reputation permanently
### **Severity**
critical
### **Tools Affected**
  - apollo
  - instantly
  - lemlist
  - outreach
### **Situation**
Sending cold emails from main company domain
### **Why**
  If your main domain gets blacklisted:
  - All company email goes to spam
  - Very hard to recover (months)
  - Affects customer communication too
  - Some blacklists are permanent
  
  This is the #1 cold email mistake.
  
### **Solution**
  1. NEVER use main domain for cold outreach
  2. Buy separate domains (variant names)
  3. Warm up domains for 2-3 weeks before sending
  4. Monitor deliverability metrics
  5. Use dedicated cold email infrastructure
  
  ```
  # Bad:
  john@company.com sending cold
  
  # Good:
  john@trycompany.io (separate, warmed domain)
  ```
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Reply rates suddenly drop
  - Emails bouncing
  - Marketing emails going to spam

## Spam Trap Lists

### **Id**
spam-trap-lists
### **Summary**
Purchased lists often contain spam traps
### **Severity**
high
### **Tools Affected**
  - apollo
  - zoominfo
  - lusha
  - cognism
### **Situation**
Buying or scraping email lists and blasting them
### **Why**
  ESP providers and anti-spam companies plant fake emails:
  - Spam traps look like real addresses
  - Hitting them = instant blacklist
  - No legit person would email these
  - Even big data providers have some
  
  One spam trap can end your outreach program.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Always verify emails before sending
  2. Use verification tools (NeverBounce, ZeroBounce)
  3. Start with small test sends
  4. Remove bounces immediately
  5. Don't email anyone who hasn't engaged in 6+ months
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Sudden blacklisting
  - ESP account suspended
  - Deliverability crashes overnight

## Linkedin Automation Ban

### **Id**

### **Summary**
LinkedIn aggressively bans automation
### **Severity**
high
### **Tools Affected**
  - apollo
  - lemlist
  - phantombuster
### **Situation**
Using LinkedIn automation at scale
### **Why**
  LinkedIn detects and bans automation:
  - Browser fingerprinting
  - Activity pattern detection
  - API monitoring
  - Connection request limits
  
  Losing your LinkedIn profile = losing your network.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Stay under daily limits (20-30 connections/day)
  2. Use tools that mimic human behavior
  3. Randomize activity patterns
  4. Don't run automation 24/7
  5. Use Sales Navigator for higher limits

## Data Decay

### **Severity**
high
### **Tools Affected**
  - zoominfo
  - apollo
  - lusha
  - clearbit
### **Situation**
Treating data as accurate without verification
### **Why**
  People change jobs constantly:
  - 30-40% of B2B data stale within a year
  - Direct dials change even faster
  - Company data (size, tech) changes
  - Even "fresh" data can be months old
  
  Sending to bad data = bounces = reputation damage.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Verify emails before major campaigns
  2. Look for job change signals
  3. Re-verify data older than 3-6 months
  4. Use waterfall enrichment (multiple sources)
  5. Remove bounces immediately
  
### **Symptoms**
  - High bounce rates (>3%)
  - Wrong person replies
  - Job titles don't match

## Enrichment Credit Explosion

Enrichment credits can burn faster than expected
### **Severity**
medium
### **Tools Affected**
  - clay
  - clearbit

### **Situation**
Running enrichment on large lists without budgeting
### **Why**
  Credits add up quickly:
  - Each enrichment field = credits
  - Waterfall tries multiple sources
  - Re-enrichment doubles cost
  - "Just checking" burns credits too
  
  Easy to 10x your expected spend.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Budget credits per campaign upfront
  2. Pre-filter lists before enrichment
  3. Only enrich fields you actually use
  4. Set up credit alerts at 50%, 75%
  5. Audit credit usage weekly
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Hit credit limit mid-month
  - Unexpected overage charges
  - Can't enrich at end of month

AI-generated emails all sound the same
### **Severity**
medium
### **Tools Affected**
