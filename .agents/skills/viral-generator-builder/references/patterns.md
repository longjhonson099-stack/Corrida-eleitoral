  #### **Implementation**
    ## Generator Architecture
    
    ### The Viral Generator Formula
    ```
    Input (minimal) → Magic (your algorithm) → Result (shareable)
    ```
    
    ### Input Design
    | Type | Example | Virality |
    |------|---------|----------|
    | Name only | "Enter your name" | High (low friction) |
    | Birthday | "Enter your birth date" | High (personal) |
    | Quiz answers | "Answer 5 questions" | Medium (more investment) |
    | Photo upload | "Upload a selfie" | High (personalized) |
    
    ### Result Types That Get Shared
    1. **Identity results** - "You are a..."
    2. **Comparison results** - "You're 87% like..."
    3. **Prediction results** - "In 2025 you will..."
    4. **Score results** - "Your score: 847/1000"
    5. **Visual results** - Avatar, badge, certificate
    
    ### The Screenshot Test
    - Result must look good as a screenshot
    - Include branding subtly
    - Make text readable on mobile
    - Add share buttons but design for screenshots

  #### **Name**
Quiz Builder Pattern
  #### **Description**
Building personality quizzes that spread
  #### **When To Use**
When building quiz-style generators
  #### **Implementation**
    ## Quiz Builder Pattern
    
    ### Quiz Structure
    ```
    5-10 questions → Weighted scoring → One of N results
    ```
    
    ### Question Design
    | Type | Engagement |
    |------|------------|
    | Image choice | Highest |
    | This or that | High |
    | Slider scale | Medium |
    | Multiple choice | Medium |
    | Text input | Low |
    
    ### Result Categories
    - 4-8 possible results (sweet spot)
    - Each result should feel desirable
    - Results should feel distinct
    - Include "rare" results for sharing
    
    ### Scoring Logic
    ```javascript
    // Simple weighted scoring
    const scores = { typeA: 0, typeB: 0, typeC: 0, typeD: 0 };
    
    answers.forEach(answer => {
      scores[answer.type] += answer.weight;
    });
    
    const result = Object.entries(scores)
      .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])[0][0];
    ```
    
    ### Result Page Elements
    - Big, bold result title
    - Flattering description
    - Shareable image/card
    - "Share your result" buttons
    - "See what friends got" CTA
    - Subtle retake option

  #### **Name**
Name Generator Pattern
  #### **Description**
Building name generators that people love
  #### **When To Use**
When building any name/text generator
  #### **Implementation**
    ## Name Generator Pattern
    
    ### Generator Types
    | Type | Example | Algorithm |
    |------|---------|-----------|
    | Deterministic | "Your Star Wars name" | Hash of input |
    | Random + seed | "Your rapper name" | Seeded random |
    | AI-powered | "Your brand name" | LLM generation |
    | Combinatorial | "Your fantasy name" | Word parts |
    
    ### The Deterministic Trick
    Same input = same output = shareable!
    ```javascript
    function generateName(input) {
      const hash = simpleHash(input.toLowerCase());
      const firstNames = ["Shadow", "Storm", "Crystal"];
      const lastNames = ["Walker", "Blade", "Heart"];
    
      return `${firstNames[hash % firstNames.length]} ${lastNames[(hash >> 8) % lastNames.length]}`;
    }
    ```
    
    ### Making Results Feel Personal
    - Use their actual name in the result
    - Reference their input cleverly
    - Add a "meaning" or backstory
    - Include a visual representation
    
    ### Shareability Boosters
    - "Your [X] name is:" format
    - Certificate/badge design
    - Compare with friends feature
    - Daily/weekly changing results

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Forgettable Results
  #### **Description**
Results that don't trigger sharing
  #### **Why Bad**
    Generic results don't get shared.
    "You are creative" - so what?
    No identity moment.
    Nothing to screenshot.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Make results specific and identity-forming.
    "You're a Midnight Architect" > "You're creative"
    Add visual flair.
    Make it screenshot-worthy.

  #### **Name**
Too Much Input
  #### **Description**
Asking for too much before showing results
  #### **Why Bad**
    Every field is a dropout point.
    People want instant gratification.
    Long forms kill virality.
    Mobile users bounce.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Minimum viable input.
    Start with just name or one question.
    Progressive disclosure if needed.
    Show progress if longer.

  #### **Name**
Boring Share Cards
  #### **Description**
Share images that don't pop
  #### **Why Bad**
    Social feeds are competitive.
    Bland cards get scrolled past.
    No click = no viral loop.
    Wasted opportunity.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Design for the feed.
    Bold colors, clear text.
    Result visible without clicking.
    Your branding subtle but present.
