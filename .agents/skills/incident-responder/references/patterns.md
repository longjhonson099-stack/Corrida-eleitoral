# Incident Responder

## Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
The Incident Response Framework
  #### **Description**
Systematic approach to handling any incident
  #### **When**
Any production incident occurs
  #### **Example**
    # THE OODA LOOP FOR INCIDENTS:
    # Observe → Orient → Decide → Act → (Repeat)
    
    ## PHASE 1: DETECT AND ACKNOWLEDGE (first 5 minutes)
    """
    ✓ Acknowledge the alert
    ✓ Open incident channel (#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-title)
    ✓ Post initial summary:
      - What's broken? "Orders API returning 500s"
      - Who's affected? "All checkout users"
      - When did it start? "2:45 PM based on alerts"
      - Who's responding? "@alice is incident commander"
    """
    
    ## PHASE 2: ASSESS SEVERITY
    """
    SEV1 - Critical
    - Core functionality completely broken
    - Data loss or security breach
    - All users affected
    → All hands, wake people up
    
    SEV2 - Major
    - Significant feature broken
    - Many users affected
    - Workaround may exist
    → On-call + relevant owners
    
    SEV3 - Minor
    - Limited feature affected
    - Few users impacted
    - Easy workaround exists
    → On-call handles, may defer
    
    SEV4 - Low
    - Cosmetic or minor issue
    - No user impact
    → Next business day
    """
    
    ## PHASE 3: MITIGATE (first priority)
    """
    Ask: "What's the fastest way to stop the bleeding?"
    
    Options (in order of preference):
    1. Rollback recent deploy
    2. Feature flag off the broken feature
    3. Scale up / failover
    4. Block problematic traffic
    5. Apply hotfix (if fast and safe)
    
    DO NOT: Spend 30 minutes debugging before trying rollback
    """
    
    ## PHASE 4: COMMUNICATE
    """
    Every 30 minutes, post update:
    - Current status
    - What we've tried
    - What we're trying next
    - Expected next update time
    
    Stakeholders need to know we're working on it.
    Silence is terrifying.
    """
    
    ## PHASE 5: RESOLVE AND VERIFY
    """
    When you think it's fixed:
    1. Monitor for 15-30 minutes
    2. Verify with affected users/flows
    3. Check metrics return to baseline
    4. THEN declare resolved
    """
    
    ## PHASE 6: POST-INCIDENT
    """
    Immediately:
    - Timeline document started
    - Incident channel kept open for notes
    
    Within 48 hours:
    - Post-mortem written
    - Action items created
    - Meeting scheduled

    - "Let's try the rollback"

    - "Let's give this 10 more minutes"
    
    A decision made quickly beats a perfect decision made slowly.

    You decide when incident is over.

Rollback vs Fix Forward
  #### **Description**
Deciding how to resolve the incident

Incident caused by recent change
  #### **Example**
    # THE ROLLBACK DECISION:
    
    ## Default: Rollback
    """
    If a recent deploy caused the incident,
    rollback should be your first instinct.
    
    WHY:
    - Immediately restores known-good state
    - Doesn't require understanding the bug
    - Low risk (returning to tested code)
    - Buys time to fix properly
    """
    
    ## When to Rollback:
    - Recent deploy correlates with incident
    - Rollback is fast (< 10 minutes)
    - No data migration makes rollback complex
    - Root cause is unclear
    
    ## When to Fix Forward:
    - Rollback is impossible (data migration)
    - Fix is obvious and quick (< 5 minutes)
    - Rollback would cause worse problems
    - Root cause is clear and fix is safe

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Hero Debugging
  #### **Description**
One person trying to solve everything alone
  #### **Why**
    The lone hero works in isolation, doesn't communicate, and creates a single
    point of failure. When they get stuck or burned out, nobody knows what's
    been tried. Team collaboration solves incidents faster.
    
  #### **Instead**
Designate roles. Communicate constantly. Work in pairs if possible. Share what you're trying.

---
  #### **Name**
Blame Storming
  #### **Description**
Post-mortem focused on who caused the incident
  #### **Why**
    Blame discourages transparency. People hide mistakes instead of reporting them.
    Future incidents are worse because people don't admit early warnings. Learning
    stops when punishment begins.
    
  #### **Instead**
Focus on contributing factors. Ask "what" and "how," not "who." Blame the process, improve the system.

---
  #### **Name**
Premature All-Clear
  #### **Description**
Declaring incident resolved too quickly
  #### **Why**
    "It looks fixed" is not "it's fixed." Declaring resolution too early leads to
    repeat pages, eroded trust, and incomplete fixes. The incident might not
    actually be resolved.
    
  #### **Instead**
Wait 15-30 minutes after fix. Check metrics return to baseline. Verify with affected flows.

---
  #### **Name**
Fix Without Understanding
  #### **Description**
Applying changes until something works
  #### **Why**
    Random changes might mask the problem or cause new ones. Without understanding
    the cause, you can't prevent recurrence. You might make things worse.
    
  #### **Instead**
Mitigate first (rollback), then understand. Don't ship a "fix" you don't understand.

---
  #### **Name**
Silent Incident
  #### **Description**
Working on incident without communicating
  #### **Why**
    Stakeholders panic when they see impact but hear nothing. Duplicate work
    happens when people don't know who's handling what. Trust erodes with silence.
    
  #### **Instead**
Post updates every 30 minutes. Even "still investigating" is better than silence.

---
  #### **Name**
Alert Fatigue Acceptance
  #### **Description**
Ignoring alerts because there are too many
  #### **Why**
    Noisy alerts train teams to ignore alerts. When a real incident happens,
    it's missed in the noise. On-call becomes meaningless rotation.
    
  #### **Instead**
Every alert should be actionable. Fix or delete noisy alerts. Quality over quantity.
