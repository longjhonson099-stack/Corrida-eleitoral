    ## Groups vs Channels
    
    ### Telegram Channels
    - One-way broadcast
    - Unlimited subscribers
    - No member list visible
    - Best for: Announcements, content
    
    ### Telegram Groups
    - Two-way conversation
    - Up to 200K members
    - Member interaction
    - Best for: Community, support
    
    ### Recommended Setup
    ```
    MAIN CHANNEL (announcements)
    ├── Linked Discussion Group
    └── (Optional) Comments enabled
    
    COMMUNITY GROUP (conversation)
    ├── Main chat
    └── (Optional) Topic threads
    
    SUPPORT GROUP (help)
    └── Separate from main chat
    ```
    
    ### When to Split
    | Situation | Action |
    |-----------|--------|
    | > 5K members, noisy | Consider topic threads |
    | Different languages | Language-specific groups |
    | Different purposes | Separate groups |
    | Too many support Qs | Dedicated support group |
